=head1 NAME

WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::Sleepy - A WWW::Mechanize plugin to provide the behaviour of WWW::Mechanize::Sleepy while using WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Set all Mechanize objects to sleep for 5 seconds between requests:

    use WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable Sleepy => [ sleep => 5 ];

or, set single Mechanize instance to sleep for 5 seconds between requests:

    use WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable;
    
    my $mech = WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable->new( sleep => 5 );

To change sleep time:

    $mech->sleep(2);    # now sleep for 2 seconds per request

To sleep for a random number of seconds, specify the range as a string in the
following format:

    'i1..i2'
    
    # e.g. will sleep between 5 and 10 seconds, inclusive
    $mech->sleep('5..10');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module makes it easy to slow down L<WWW::Mechanize> when using
L<WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable>, in the manner of L<WWW::Mechanize::Sleepy>.

The code merely adds hooks containing a C<sleep()> before several
WWW::Mechanize methods, but is possibly preferable to scattering C<sleep()>s
throughout code in order to slow down tests, for example.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 sleep

    $mech->sleep(1);
    $mech->sleep('5..10');
    
    my $sleep = $mech->sleep;

Get/set sleep time

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Code and tests based on L<WWW::Mechanize::Sleepy>
